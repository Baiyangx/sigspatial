\begin{abstract} 
Diverse efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have continued throughout the
past two years. Governments have announced plans for unprecedentedly rapid
vaccine development, quarantine measures, and economic revitalization. They
contribute to a more effective pandemic response by determining the precise
opinions of individuals regarding these mitigation measures. In this paper,
we propose a deep learning-based topic monitoring and storyline extraction
system for COVID-19 that is capable of analyzing public sentiment and
pandemic trends. The proposed method is able to retrieve Twitter data related
to COVID-19 and conduct spatiotemporal analysis. In addition to
spatiotemporal data mining, the system implements a sentiment analysis on
Twitter users. Furthermore, a deep learning component of the system provides
monitoring and modeling capabilities for topics based on the most advanced
natural language processing models. The proposed system includes a
user-interactive visualization component that provides audience monitoring
and analytical toolboxes. Case studies found in abundance in our proposed
system can justify empirical analysis. Ultimately, we believe that our
proposed system accurately reflects how public sentiments change over time
and locations, along with specific pandemic topics.
